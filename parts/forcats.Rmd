R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. Factors are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of tools that solve common problems with factors, including changing the order of levels or the values. Some examples include:

* `fct_reorder()`: Reordering a factor by another variable.
* `fct_infreq()`: Reordering a factor by the frequency of values.
* `fct_relevel()`: Changing the order of a factor by hand.
* `fct_lump()`: Collapsing the least/most frequent values of a factor into "other".
